# Test defined syntax parser
This script is just for my test.

## What it does ?
It can parse a sentence of Japanese in ASCII.
It outputs its structure of the given sentence.

## Why it is written ?
My test.
Prolog is a very unique languege so I need to confirm its enjoyment
since I've never written for several years.
